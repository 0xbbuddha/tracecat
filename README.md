# Tracecat

Tracecat is an open source Tines alternative.

## Quickstart

Run `docker compose up` to spin up Tracecat's automation engine and low-code frontend.

## Development

Tracecat uses NGINX as an API gateway to the `api` and `runner` services.
You can access these services respectively via the `/api/` and `/runner/` endpoints.
