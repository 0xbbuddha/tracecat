[Tracecat](https://tracecat.com) is an open-source Tines / Splunk SOAR alternative for security engineers. We're building the features of Tines using enterprise-grade open-source tools.

## Who uses Tracecat?

- **Security Operations (SecOps):** Unify workflow development across security engineering and SOC teams
- **Security Engineers (SecEng):** Build and maintain complex automations using open source integrations, configuration-as-code, and a powerful templating language
- **Managed Detection & Response (MDR):** Rapidly embed scalable workflow applications into any security product
