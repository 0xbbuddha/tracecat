A workflow is the most central Tracecat object.
It is a collection of actions that are executed in a specific order.
Workflows can be triggered by a variety of events, such as a schedule or an external event.

## Overview

Workflows can be thought of as a special class of functions that run smaller functions.

- Workflows can be committed in either operating mode into a [Workflow Definition](/concepts/workflow-definitions).

## Triggers

We support:

- **Webhooks**: Trigger a workflow by sending an HTTP request to a webhook URL.
- **Schedules**: Trigger a workflow at a specific time or interval.

Each workflow has only one entrypoint, which is the first action to run when the workflow is triggered.

## Orchestration Layer

You could very well run an entire workflow inside a single action, but in exchange you would be giving up:

1. **Resilience**: If an action fails, the entire workflow fails.
2. **Observability**: It's hard to see what's happening inside a single action.

- Decouple the orchestration logic from the execution logic

### Durable execution with Temporal

- Temporal allows us to reliably execute long-running workflows
- Temporal resumes the workflow's local state (including variables and memory) when a Temporal activity fails

## Child Workflows

Workflows can trigger other workflows through a simple HTTP request. This allows you to create complex workflows by composing together simpler workflows.

<Note>
  We are working towards better design and implementation of child workflows.
  Currently child workflows don't inherit the parent workflow's execution
  context.
