A workflow is the most central Tracecat object.
It is a collection of actions that are executed in a specific order.
Workflows can be triggered by a variety of events, such as a schedule or an external event.

## Overview

Workflows can be thought of as a special class of functions that manage the running of actions.

- Workflows can be committed in either operating mode into a [Workflow Definition](/concepts/workflow-definitions).

## Triggers

Each workflow has only one entrypoint, which is the first action to run when the workflow is triggered.
A workflow with more than one entrypoint will fail at commit time.

Kinds of triggers we support:

- [**Webhooks**](/concepts/webhooks): Trigger a workflow by sending an HTTP request to a webhook URL.
- [**Schedules**](/concepts/schedules): Trigger a workflow at a specific time or interval.

## Orchestration Layer

Tracecat's workflow orchestration layer is built on top of Temporal, an open-source, stateful, and resilient orchestration engine.
By offloading the orchestation logic to Temporal, we can fully focus on the execution logic here at Tracecat.

## Child Workflows

Workflows can trigger other workflows through a simple HTTP request. This allows you to create complex workflows by composing together simpler workflows.

<Note>
  We are working towards better design and implementation of child workflows.
  Currently child workflows don't inherit the parent workflow's execution
  context.
