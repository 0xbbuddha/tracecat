Tracecat's flexible user interface that allows you to build workflows in **headless** or **GUI** modes -- whichever suits you best.

## Interfaces Overview

| Mode               | User interface        | Editor                        |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| GUI (graphical UI) | React+NextJS frontend | No-code drag-and-drop builder |
| Headless (no GUI)  | REST API or CLI       | IDE or text editor + YAML DSL |

Across all the documentation, when we refer to "the UI", we're talking about the any of the user interfaces.

Actions taken and edits made in either mode are reflected in the other. A workflow created in headless mode will show up in the GUI, and vice versa.

<Warning>
This two-way sync functionality is a work in progress. It's missing:

- Workflow changes in headless mode should update the GUI graph object.

**What this means for you now**:

- For each workflow you create, please use its respective mode to edit it.

</Warning>

## Headless mode

In headless mode, workflows are built and edited using your IDE or text editor with a YAML-like DSL. More on this in the [workflows](/concepts/workflows) section.
To operate Tracecat, this is done via the [REST API](/api-reference) or CLI.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

Tracecat's CLI thinly wraps around the REST API. It's built using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and requres Python to be installed.
We recommend using the CLI if you can, as it's a more user-friendly interface compared to hitting the API directly. Please refer to the [CLI installation](/installation#headless-mode-only) guide for more information.

_NOTE: We have plans to make the CLI more portable in the future._

## GUI mode

In graphical UI (GUI) mode, you use our React+NextJS frontend to create and edit workflows, manage secrets, and view logs.

### Workspace

The workspace is where you manage your workflows, secrets, and events.

#### Catalog

- The left side panel Where you'll find all available actions.
- Drag and drop an action block onto the workflow canvas.
- Custom UDFs can be configured to show up here.

#### Canvas

- Drag-and-drop builder UI for creating workflows.
- Drag an action block from the catalog onto the workflow canvas.
- If a canvas action is selected, clicking on a catalog action places and connects the new block.

#### Configuration Panel

- The right side panel that changes depending on the current selection.
- Select your action onto the canvas to open its configuration panel.
- Update the action name, description, and inputs here.
- Press `save` to save the action.

### Navbar

- Commit changes to the workflow.
- Enable or disable the workflow.
