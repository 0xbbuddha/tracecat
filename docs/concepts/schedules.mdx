description: Execute workflows from scheduled or external events.

Scheduling is one of the primary reasons for using an orchestrator such as Tracecat.
Tracecat allows you to use schedules to automatically create new workflow runs.

A schedule contains information that Tracecat uses to execute workflows for you automatically on a specified cadence.
You can add multiple schedules to any workflow. The Tracecat scheduler (built on Temporal) periodically reviews every workflow and executes them according to their configued schedule.
